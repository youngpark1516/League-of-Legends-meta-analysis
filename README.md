The histogram shows a bimodal distribution heavily skewed to the right. 

The skew suggests that most of the observations were concentrated on the lower end of the range, with the long tail implying that there are certain cases where players deal significantly higher damages.

Further, the bimodal nature suggests that there is a more complex underlying pattern in damage distribution.
